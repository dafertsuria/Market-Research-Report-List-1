<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Injection Molding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Runner</li><li>Hot Runner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Injection Molding Market is categorized into two main types: cold runner and hot runner systems. Cold runner systems use a solidified channel to transport molten plastic to the mold, which can result in more material waste but is generally simpler and less costly. In contrast, hot runner systems keep the material in a molten state, improving cycle times and reducing waste, making them suitable for high-volume production of intricate medical components. Both systems cater to diverse medical manufacturing needs.</p></p>
