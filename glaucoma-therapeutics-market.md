<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prostaglandin Analogs</li><li>Beta Blockers</li><li>Alpha Agonists</li><li>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glaucoma therapeutics market encompasses various drug classes used to manage intraocular pressure. Prostaglandin analogs enhance outflow of aqueous humor, offering once-daily dosing for convenience. Beta blockers reduce aqueous humor production, with some formulations available as preservative-free options. Alpha agonists also decrease production while increasing outflow, often used alongside other therapies. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, available in oral and topical forms, inhibit carbonic anhydrase to lower fluid production, serving as adjunct therapy for more complex cases.</p></p>
